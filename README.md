# Mining-ECG

The waveform data underlying the PTB-XL ECG dataset was collected with devices from Schiller AG over the course of nearly seven years between October 1989 and June 1996. With the acquisition of the original database from Schiller AG, the full usage rights were transferred to the PTB. The records were curated and converted into a structured database within a long-term project at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The database was used in a number of publications, see e.g. [1,2], but the access remained restricted until now. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved the publication of the anonymous data in an open-access database (PTB-2020-1). During the public release process in 2019, the existing database was streamlined with particular regard to usability and accessibility for the machine learning community. Waveform and metadata were converted to open data formats that can easily processed by standard software.
